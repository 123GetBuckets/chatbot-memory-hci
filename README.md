# abstract
*how can we reveal a chatbotâ€™s memory state and allow a user to manipulate its memory representation?*
### interface design
we have a general sense of the system design and mechanisms, but we need to iterate on the interface design for a minimum viable product.
### development work
we use `next.js` for rapid prototyping of a frontend and backend.
### irb approval
we need irb approval for our system evaluation. it takes months for processing.
